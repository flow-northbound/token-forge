This simple, accessible, and powerful colour palette works well in most 
cases. It does have a limitation that comes with using solid colours though. 
We’ll look at this limitation later. We’ll also consider the advantages of using 
transparent colours for more complex websites and apps.

Let’s create a simple solid colour palette first.
Brand
Q I’m using a hue of 230 for my brand colour. I’m also using the brand colour 
to indicate interactive elements like buttons and text links5
Q Must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the “fill” variation, as a 
text link could sit on a “fill” background.
Text strong
Q Greatly decrease the brightness of the brand colour. Aim for a very dark 
grey with a tinge of the brand colour. Because this variation is so dark, 
you’ll need to saturate it quite heavily.
Q Must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the “fill” variation, as it’s 
used for primary text that could sit on a “fill” background.
Text weak
Q Increase the brightness and decrease the saturation of the previous 
variation. Aim for a dark grey with a tinge of the brand colour.
